## SQL Database for Credit Card and Customer Data

This repository contains SQL scripts to create a database for storing and analyzing credit card and customer transaction data. The scripts include creating the necessary tables, importing data from CSV files, and resolving common import issues.

### Project Structure

- `ccdb.sql`: SQL script for creating and importing data into the `cc_detail` and `cust_detail` tables.
- `credit_card.csv`: Sample CSV file for credit card transaction data.
- `customer.csv`: Sample CSV file for customer information data.
- `cc_add.csv`: Additional data for the `cc_detail` table (e.g., Week-53 data).
- `cust_add.csv`: Additional data for the `cust_detail` table.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the database and import data:

### 1. Create the Database

First, create a new database where all the data will be stored:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE ccdb;
```

### 2. Create the Tables

Run the SQL script to create two primary tables: `cc_detail` for credit card transactions and `cust_detail` for customer details.

```sql
-- Creating cc_detail table
CREATE TABLE cc_detail (
    Client_Num INT,
    Card_Category VARCHAR(20),
    Annual_Fees INT,
    Activation_30_Days INT,
    Customer_Acq_Cost INT,
    Week_Start_Date DATE,
    Week_Num VARCHAR(20),
    Qtr VARCHAR(10),
    current_year INT,
    Credit_Limit DECIMAL(10,2),
    Total_Revolving_Bal INT,
    Total_Trans_Amt INT,
    Total_Trans_Ct INT,
    Avg_Utilization_Ratio DECIMAL(10,3),
    Use_Chip VARCHAR(10),
    Exp_Type VARCHAR(50),
    Interest_Earned DECIMAL(10,3),
    Delinquent_Acc VARCHAR(5)
);

-- Creating cust_detail table
CREATE TABLE cust_detail (
    Client_Num INT,
    Customer_Age INT,
    Gender VARCHAR(5),
    Dependent_Count INT,
    Education_Level VARCHAR(50),
    Marital_Status VARCHAR(20),
    State_cd VARCHAR(50),
    Zipcode VARCHAR(20),
    Car_Owner VARCHAR(5),
    House_Owner VARCHAR(5),
    Personal_Loan VARCHAR(5),
    Contact VARCHAR(50),
    Customer_Job VARCHAR(50),
    Income INT,
    Cust_Satisfaction_Score INT
);
```

### 3. Import Data

Once the tables are created, use the `COPY` command to import data from CSV files into the corresponding tables.

```sql
-- Import credit card data into cc_detail
COPY cc_detail
FROM 'D:\credit_card.csv' 
DELIMITER ',' 
CSV HEADER;

-- Import customer data into cust_detail
COPY cust_detail
FROM 'D:\customer.csv' 
DELIMITER ',' 
CSV HEADER;
```
